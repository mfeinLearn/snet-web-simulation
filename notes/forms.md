form_tag
- tipically for a login
people usually use this bc
the login does not create
a new user
- login people usually use
a form tag. they are just
accessing a user that
already existed

form_for
- for sign up use form for
because it is a form
for a new user and
 we are creating that user

 password in form for
 because if we


we dont want to
overriding all of the auth
if we directly set the password_digest
we should always set the password and it will set it
for me
